\noindent  This comprehensive research paper delves into the imperative task of enhancing data security and
privacy within the realm of cloud storage. The study meticulously explores a spectrum of
encryption methods, including one-to-many encryption, data integrity checks, resilient data deletion
mechanisms, and privacy-preserving solutions. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as
Advanced Encryption Standards (AES), Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA), and searchable encryption,
the research integrates privacy-preserving techniques and machine learning into cloud
environments.
A pivotal aspect of the investigation involves the implementation of a load balancer in conjunction
with GitHub to optimize the distribution and management of data for a single user across multiple
repositories. This strategic utilization of technology ensures efficient data storage and distribution
within cloud infrastructures. Furthermore, the research extends its focus to post-quantum
encryption, fortifying security measures against emerging threats and highlighting the ongoing
necessity of exploring evolving data encryption technologies in cloud storage.
In conclusion, the paper underscores the significance of continuous research aligned with identified
security needs. It emphasizes the persistent need for exploring evolving security requirements, with
a specific emphasis on the role of load balancing in optimizing data storage and distribution. The
research concludes by outlining future plans to delve deeper into these evolving security demands,
ensuring that cloud storage systems remain robust and resilient in the face of dynamic and
sophisticated threats.
